when the user clicks the booking button he land on the last page "Favorite Destinations".

User Strory:

As a busy person who has limited vacations days you don´t want your vacation to be ruined by bad weather.
So I´m  looking for a service that make sure I will find the best weather based on the activity I´m planning to do.
Since I want to save some money I look to last minute trips that are usually cheaper.
